# website-v2
So... this is my website! It took me about a total of 40 hours (yes, I'm a slow web-developer) to make the site. I relearned a lot of HTML/JS/CSS + Bootstrap in order to make this site, and furthermore, spent a lot of time making some earlier versions of this site. You can find that site [this repository named "website-old-version"](https://github.com/BlueSinkers/website-old-version)!

## Credits
All contents of the website are EXCLUSIVELY mine -- please read the copyright statement at the bottom of the site. However, I also did adapt from content made by [3PSYON](https://codepen.io/3psy0n) which you can find [here](https://codepen.io/3psy0n/pen/LYpajmX) specifically in the projects-component of my site.

## Things to work on in the website
Yes, my beautiful website has a lot of flaws... here is a to-do list of some things I hope to do/add to the website to make it better:
1. Make the website responsive. The non-card sections of the website aren't responsive and I plan to fix that over the coming months. This is by far the most important thing on the to-do list.
2. Make the linearity of the website make more sense. I discuss this in the older version of my site which you can find [here](https://github.com/BlueSinkers/website-old-version) but it still feels not very convincing that the order of progression through the site is downward.
3. Change the color-scheme -- as a colorblind individual, I'm not too sure if it looks ok, but it feels very black-and-white and I want to add some more color to the site. Although, it is very characteristic of me to have a weird-color-scheme given what I just said, so I will see about this.
3. Make the background "dunking" pictures .gif files so when the button is hovered, they will show a moving slow-motion dunk.

## Some lessons I learned while making this site:
1. KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid)
2. Be very careful with SASS and updating it without updating the CSS file -- I had many issues with updating the SASS file (.scss), not updating the CSS file by running the SASS command, and eventually changing some of my HTML code because the changes I made in my SASS file weren't visible.
3. ChatGPT is useFUL for Javacsript development, but is useLESS with HTML and CSS -- be warned if you try to use it.
4. All of the lessons mentioned [here](https://github.com/BlueSinkers/website-old-version)

## Personal Touches in the Site
As I mention in the project-card that discusses this site, I say how very important it is to me that this site sort of "reflects" who I am... it is corny, but it's something I care about. Here are a couple of hand-chosen parts of the website that really reflect me:
1. The photo that I picked of me (in the about-me section) is *very* characteristic of me. As a DMV native, the Cherry Blossoms in the pack are a no-brainer, and the Star Wars Hoodie represents one of my childhood obsessions. Also of note is that the photo is from a nearby place in my neighborhood.
2. The photos of me dunking a basketball (albeit they're kinda not *totally* real) are very characteristic of my huge love of basketball and sports in general. I love the feature I implemented that allows people to see the whole of the photo, and as mentioned earlier, aspire to turn those photos into more gif-like videos.
3. The language-switching. The languages that are switched are the following: English, Spanish, Telugu, Arabic, and French. I am fluent in English, Spanish, and Telugu, intermediate in Arabic, and am interested and have started learning French since my trip to Montreal in July 2024. The specific phrasings on the website are listed below:
    - English: **Hello, World! I'm Abhi! See ya!**
    - Spanish: **Hola, mundo! Soy Abhi! Nos vemos!**
    - Telugu:  **హలో వరల్డ్! హాయ్, నేను అభి! వీడ్కోలు!**
    - Arabic: **Marhaban bi3alam! Ana ismii Abhi! M3a salama!**
    - French: **Salut, monde! Je suis Abhi! Au revoir!**

Note that Arabic is tricky because it is right-to-left script so it won't work well in Markdown so I used Romanized versions. That being said, as a lifelong and avid language-learner, I thought adding this to some of my headers would be an excellent touch.
4. The Baloo font, which is useed throughout the website, is one of my favorite fonts and is one I've been using since I was in Middle School!
